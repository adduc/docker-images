# Translate environment variables into service definitions
#
# This is useful for running long-lived commands that are expected to
# run in the background, such as web servers, databases, or other
# services.
#
# SERVICE_APP1="nginx -g 'daemon off;'"
#
# With the above environment variable, a service is started that runs
# the command "nginx -g 'daemon off;'" in the background. When the
# command exits for any reason, the service will be restarted
# automatically.
#
# If the command should be run multiple times, a _COUNT suffix can be
# used to specify the number of times the service should be started.
# For example, if the environment variable is set to
# APP1_SERVICE_COUNT=3, the service will be started three times with the
# same command. The environment variables "SERVICE_COUNT_TOTAL" and
# "SERVICE_COUNT_INDEX" will be set to the total number of services
# started and the index of the current service (starting from 0) and can
# be used within the command to differentiate between the services.
#
# Note: services are managed through runit; the command is expected to
# run in the foreground.
